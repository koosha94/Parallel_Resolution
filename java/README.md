# Parallel_Resolution
Rapid developments of multi-core processors in the last ten years have 
accelerated the advancements in concurrency platforms. Performance of bottom-up
resolution algorithms used in logic programming and artificial intelligent 
systems, can potentially be improved using the parallel programming constructs 
offered by these platforms (e.g., OpenMP, Cilk++, etc.). In this work, we use 
Java to implement a parallel bottom-up resolution algorithm, and study how 
different parallel programming and multi-thread constructs in Java affect its 
performance. Our experimental results are designed to compare the effect of 
Java and Cilk++ constructs on parallel implementation of resolution algorithms.
This repository contains our test case, an implementation of Wumpus World 
navigator agent using Java. The code is organized as an eclipse project, in 
order to facilitate the use of source code and experiments.
